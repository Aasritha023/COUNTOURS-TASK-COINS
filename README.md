# COUNTOURS-TASK-COINS
# 🧠 Contour Detection with OpenCV – COINS Dataset

This project demonstrates how to detect and visualize contours using OpenCV on the **COINS dataset**. Contours are very useful in shape analysis, object detection, and recognition.

## 📸 Project Overview

We use various image processing techniques to detect the external and internal contours of coins in an image. This project showcases how to:
- Convert images to grayscale
- Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise
- Use thresholding for binary segmentation
- Detect and draw contours using `cv2.findContours()`
- Understand and visualize contour hierarchy

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 🐍
- OpenCV (cv2) 📷
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- COINS Dataset

## 🔍 Key Features

- External vs Internal contour detection
- Bounding rectangles and contour drawing
